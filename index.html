        <h1>Polar Bear</h1>

        <p>My favorite animal is the mighty polar bear. A beautiful and isolated creature that lives only in the arctic. Polar bears are very interesting but they are also surprisingly vicious. I read somewhere that the best thing to do if you see a polar bear is run, because they have most likely been hunting you if you see them.</p>

        <p>They're also super cute!</p>
